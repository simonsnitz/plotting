# Sensor Plots

Sensor Plots is a library of scripts for plotting common forms of data associated with genetic biosensors. This library takes a semi-automated approach. The data must be formatted into xlsx sheets that, when passed through the scripts, will automatically plot the data in a standardized format.

Plotting is available for creating:
* Dose response functions
* Individual bar plots
* Grouped bar plots
* Heat maps
* Time course functions
